  I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's section 1

## Subsection 1.1

two asterisks make text bold, underscores make text italic

a line break is required to print on a separate line
So, this is the same line

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:
  
  ```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
  The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
  
# Section 3

```{r named code chunk}
dataframe1 = rnorm(500)

countif(dataframe1 > 0)

print(dataframe1)

ggplot(dataframe1)


```
```{r solution}
la_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(500)
  gr_th_0 = sample > 0
  abs_bvalue = abs(sample)
)
)
```
